# MachO's Other Tool

`mootool` is an attempt at an open source replacement to the legandary `jtool2` allowing it to continue to progress
with the Apple research community.  Ruby was selected as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) maintains a good Mach-O parser
that is pure (meaning it needs no dependencies other then a Ruby runtime).

As a secondary goal every command should provide output both in human readable as well as machien readable (YAML)
format making it suitable for use in scripting.

## Installation

The code can also be used as a library with `gem 'mootool'`
